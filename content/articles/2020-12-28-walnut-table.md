<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->

We turned an old walnut stump into a live edge coffee table. This was a first for me with lots of experimentation and learning along the way.

<!-- PELICAN_END_SUMMARY -->

## Slabs

The tree had been dead for a number of years and we slabbed it about 6 months ago. As a first experiment we cut slabs with the chainsaw while the stump was still vertical, yielding decent slabs but with some roughness and uneven thickness.

For future work I plan to use either a more sophisticated method by hand (like [this](https://youtu.be/8qz64ELkxdA)), or an [Alaskan mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw_mill#/media/File:Alaskan_chainsaw_mill.jpg) setup to get flatter slabs.

The stump is from a grafted walnut tree with—I think—the darker claro walnut *Juglans hindsii* as the root stock and the lighter English walnut *Juglans regia* above. Below is a claro walnut (black walnut) on the left, and a grafted walnut with both species on the right.

## Table Top

The first step was to smooth the top of the slab using an old Stanley No. 3 plane. Flattening would be better done with a jack plane, but the smaller No. 3 actually helped to more quickly smooth the not perfectly flat rough-cut slab and it happened to be what I had on hand. I followed that up with some course sanding with the belt sander to remove all roughness except for a few chainsaw marks left for character, and then final sanding with an orbital sander to 120 and 220 grit.

I had never done an epoxy table top before but selected [Pro Marine epoxy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0788HYTN3/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) after some research.

The top (English walnut) part of the slab had significant rot and uneven edges which complicated the process.

I taped up the edges and bottom and did a first pour over this part to see how much would be filled in.

There was significant leakage, so I turned the slab on its end to fill the largest area of rot. 


I taped up two large dams on either side which both failed with most of the epoxy leaking out before it cured. To keep things moving and since I wasn't going for perfection on this I re-taped the sides and bottom and did a final pour on the top surface which gave a mostly smooth finish with only a couple of holes not fully filled in.

The epoxy finish beautifully shows the rich grain of the walnut. I learned that this epoxy takes a *long* time to cure—I waited overnight between each pour and the length of cure time caused my troubles with leakage. A flatter slab with fewer defects would minimize these issues, or the largest defects could have been filled in with a quicker drying resin first.

I cleaned up the ends and finished the full tabletop with a couple coats of polyurethane.

## Legs

I cut the legs from another slab which had a less consistent thickness and needed some more work to finish. We ran these through a 15" thickness planer to get a uniform thickness.

Next I cut each leg to length and cut tenons with a table saw tenoning jig. I cut the matching mortises in the bottom of the table using a router.

The final product fit snugly and was a simple glue up to attach the legs to the table.

This table is not perfect but was a fun experiment and I learned a lot for future builds.
